### The Project

This project predicts the Superhost status of Airbnb properties by analyzing earning potential and success through occupancy rates and overall ratings. Using a dataset from Houston Airbnb listings, various modeling techniques, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Lasso Regression, and Ensemble models, were employed. Data cleaning involved clustering techniques to handle missing values. Models were evaluated based on R-squared and RMSE scores, revealing that overall guest ratings and occupancy rates significantly influence earning potential. The optimal model offers actionable insights for property owners to enhance revenue and achieve Superhost status.
