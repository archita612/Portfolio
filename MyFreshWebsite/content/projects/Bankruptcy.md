### The Project

![Data Mine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archita612/Portfolio/main/MyFreshWebsite/assets/images/Bankruptcy.jpg)


This project, stemming from a Kaggle competition, is centered on leveraging predictive analytics for financial risk assessment, particularly in predicting bankruptcy using SAS Enterprise Miner. Through rigorous experimentation with diverse models like Neural Network and Gradient Boosting, coupled with meticulous preprocessing techniques, the project aimed to optimize the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction. Despite encountering challenges such as model underperformance, iterative adjustments eventually led to the discovery of an effective ensemble approach, combining Gradient Boosting and Neural Network models. This solution not only highlighted the importance of algorithmic diversity but also underscored the critical role of comprehensive metric evaluation in ensuring the reliability of financial risk models. Leveraging the capabilities of SAS Enterprise Miner, this project not only tackled the complexities of bankruptcy prediction but also showcased the transformative potential of predictive analytics in augmenting decision-making processes within the financial sector, as exemplified by its origin in a competitive Kaggle environment.
