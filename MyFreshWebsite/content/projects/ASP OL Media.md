This project focuses on enhancing the database infrastructure of ASP OL Media, a prominent player in email marketing services for Forbes 100 companies. Utilizing CSV files, database construction was initiated, integrating primary and foreign keys for data integrity. Additionally, associative tables were introduced to manage complex relationships within the database. The approach entailed meticulous data cleaning and normalization techniques to minimize redundancy and enhance efficiency. Subsequently, through in-depth data analysis, insights into campaign performance metrics, such as click rates and unsubscribers, were gleaned, informing strategic decisions for future campaign optimization and operational enhancement.
