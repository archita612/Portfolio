This project delves into Spotify's pricing dynamics, investigating its current pricing structure and conducting conjoint analysis to discern user preferences. Through this comprehensive analysis, insights were derived, leading to strategic recommendations such as introducing a new "Premium Plus" tier with music video streaming. Positive market response, including a significant revenue increase, validates the efficacy of the proposed strategies.
