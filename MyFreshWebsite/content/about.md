Hello there! I am a masters student at **Purdue University** pursuing **MS** in **Business Analytics & Information Management** (MSBAIM), currently based out of West Lafayette, Indiana, US.

&nbsp; With over 3.5 years delving into the realm of analytics, focussing in e-commerce, retail, CPG industries and their supply chain segments, I had a delightful journey tackling critical challenges during all my stints – be at Kearney, Flipkart or, IBM. From delving deep into SQL and Python to crafting insightful Tableau, Power BI and Data Studio dashboards, I’ve discovered my passion for optimizing operations and facilitating data-driven optimized decisions. But I believe what truly sets me apart is my passion for continual learning and development. I have an insatiable appetite for acquiring new skills & knowledge or sharpening the existing ones. When I’m not immersed in the world of data or leading my teams on projects at my workplace, you may find me engrossed in a good book or, exploring new cuisines or, learning languages, or, listening to instrumental music or working out at the gym. &nbsp;

&nbsp; As I gear up for graduation in **August 2024**, I’m excited to bring my well-rounded professional and technical expertise onto the table, ready to embark on any challenges in the arena of data analytics & management.
